# Identification Herbal Plants
The application made is identification of herbal plants. The mission of this project is for end-to-end image classification that allows users to identify herbal plants. The system will identify herbal plants using the ResNet50 models where the models accuracy reaches 99.05% (we did models training for all datasets available on google drive in the note file). After the identification system, the results will issue information about herbal plants, the benefits of herbal plants, how to process herbal plants, and get herbal plant recommendations on e-commerce. For herbal plant recommendations, people can choose and compare herbal plants that are easier to obtain at lower prices, using the available price ranges. We hope this project can help Indonesian people in using herbal plants. This is just a simple product, feel free to develop for feature improvement!
